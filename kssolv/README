To use the code, cd into the crd-kssolv directory and type
KSSOLV_Startup to set up all paths.

You can then cd into the example directory, and type sih4_scf to run the simple SCF calculation for the SiH4 molecule

At this point (June, 2017), KSSOLV appears to need MATLAB version R2013b or higher. Some earlier versions appear to suffer 
conflicts with the calling syntax of repmat.
