Getting started
==================================

This section shows how one can use KSSOLV2.0 to set up and solve 
a simple problem.

To get started, let us start a MATLAB interactive session.

Move into the directory in which KSSOLV2.0 is installed. The directory should
contain the file 

    KSSOLV_Startup.m

Type 'KSSOLV_Startup' (without the single quotes) at the MATLAB command
window:

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> KSSOLV_Startup

This m-file makes all KSSOLV2.0 functions in different directories 
accessible from the command line.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Start/atom_setup
   Start/molecule_setup
   Start/scf_setup
