Freqmask
==================================

Freqmask is a class that keeps track of the set of reciprocal space grid 
points defined by the user defined kinetic energy cutoff parameter Ecut.
KSSOLV works with reciprocal space grid points that are inside a sphere of
radius :math:`r = \sqrt{\mathrm{Ecut}^2/2}`.
