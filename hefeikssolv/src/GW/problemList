1. Do we need isrtrq in k-points calculation? 
   If yes, how? --> BLAS vs elementwise
2. We need to support standard inputs.
3. Scalarize jobs

My problem 
  a. when mol.supercell is not diagonal, PROBLEMS 
	  1. ksinfo.bdot needs to be checked
		2. coulG(:, 1:3) needs to be checked
  b. when performs full frequency calculation, it seems that the current strategy is silly. We need a smarter FREQUENCIES SELECTING STRATEGY.
  c. Strategies of Coulomb potential and DIFFERENCE, NEED SOME PAPERS.
	d. We notice some combination of (ibandouter, ibandinner) performs poor in fullfreq_cd.
	   NEED DETAILED NUMERICAL ANALYSIS.
	e. freq0 with freqevalmin --> check BGW code. 
	f. ADD EVERY TEST TO FUNCTION. 
	  gwsetup
		gwCalculation
		  ...
		mtxel_sigma
