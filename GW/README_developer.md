## Functions

## Current progress

- [ ] GW_GPP
  - [x] Move and adjust from _swp to here
- [x] GW_FULLFREQ_CD
  - [x] Move and adjust from _swp to here
  - [x] Some adjustmwhos
  - [ ] ents are needed, check gw_fullfreq_cd for details
- [ ] GW_FULLFREQ_RA
  - [ ] Move and adjust from _swp to here
  - [ ] Some details work are needed, including numerical integral analysis.

## To do
- [] finish and test gw_fullfreq_cd_, check if it is the same as gw_fullfreq_cd.
- [] (For others to do) GPU support on GW module, mainly isdf_kernelg.m
     You can possible based on isdf_kernelg.old.m
